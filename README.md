# Customer Segmentation and Market Analysis

## Introduction

This project focuses on the exploration of customer segmentation through the use of machine learning techniques. We leverage a dataset from an online retail business based in the UK that operates without a physical storefront. The dataset spans from December 1, 2010, to December 9, 2011, providing a comprehensive view of transactions during this period.

### Objective:
1. **Customer Segmentation**: To group customers into distinct categories based on purchasing behavior.
2. **Association Rule Mining**: Discover interesting purchasing patterns and relationships among products. This can be particularly useful for strategies like market basket analysis.

By the end of this project, we aim to derive actionable insights that can assist the business in tailoring marketing strategies, making inventory decisions, and enhancing the overall customer shopping experience.

> **Note**: For visualization, we will utilize `seaborn` for its elegance and simplicity. However, for more interactive and complex visualizations, `dash` might be considered as part of the project's extension.
